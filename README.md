# bounded-rational-agent
A prompt-defined, bounded rationality agent for behavioral economics experiments
# Bounded Rational Agent Prompt

This is a structured, natural-language-defined agent designed for bounded rationality experiments in behavioral economics.

## Features

- Session-bounded, non-evolving agent prompt
- Simulates satisficing behavior, rational inattention, and session-only learning
- Utility hook structure: `U = f(self, others, weights)`
- Modular prompt architecture with clear logic paths
- Inspired by Robson & Freeman's utility theory and behavioral design

## Files

- `agent_prompt.txt`: the core prompt defining the agent
- `examples/`: use cases (e.g., social allocation, bracketing behavior)
- `docs/`: design notes, theoretical motivations
